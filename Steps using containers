#### Steps to deploy frappe containers ####

### Clone frappe docker
git clone https://github.com/frappe/frappe_docker my_frappe_docker
cd my_frappe_docker


### For development, and to set up VSCODE:
### Already configured in the frappe docker repository :)
cp -R devcontainer-example .devcontainer
cp -R development/vscode-example development/.vscode
code .

### The directory my_frappe_docker can have multiple benches that dont conflict with each other.
### You can have a container running, then stop it and re-run another one to continue development, etc...
